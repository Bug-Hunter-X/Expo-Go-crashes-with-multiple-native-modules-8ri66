The solution is to avoid using Expo Go for testing apps with a high number of native modules. Instead, use one of the following methods:

1. **Use Expo managed workflow:** This allows you to build your app using Expo's build service, which has more resources and can handle complex native modules more effectively.
2. **Use EAS Build:** This is a similar service to Expo's build service and addresses the same issue.
3. **Test on a physical device:** This will provide a more reliable testing environment than Expo Go.
